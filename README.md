# RTE_ElectricityConsumption_PredictionModelEvaluation
In this notebook we will evaluate the RTE electricity consumption prediction model.
## What is RTE ?
Réseau de Transport d'Électricité ("Electricity Transmission Network"), usually known as RTE, is the electricity transmission system operator of France.

In this notebook, we are going to  :

Discover the RTE real time data and prediction API

Automate the collection of data.

Visualize the data.

Calculate the mean absolute error (MAE) and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of the RTE electricity consumption prediction model.
# The result
The MAPE calculated is 1.211% , go and see how we get to this.
